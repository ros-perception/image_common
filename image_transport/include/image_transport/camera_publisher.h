/**
 * \brief Manages advertisements for publishing camera images.
 *
 * CameraPublisher is a convenience class for publishing synchronized image and
 * camera info topics using the standard topic naming convention, where the info
 * topic name is "camera_info" in the same namespace as the base image topic.
 *
 * On the client side, CameraSubscriber simplifies subscribing to camera images.
 *
 * A CameraPublisher should always be created through a call to
 * ImageTransport::advertiseCamera(), or copied from one that was.
 * Once all copies of a specific CameraPublisher go out of scope, any subscriber callbacks
 * associated with that handle will stop being called. Once all CameraPublisher for a
 * given base topic go out of scope the topic (and all subtopics) will be unadvertised.
