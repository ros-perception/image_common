/**
 * \brief Manages advertisements of multiple transport options on an Image topic.
 *
 * Publisher is a drop-in replacement for ros::Publisher when publishing
 * Image topics. In a minimally built environment, they behave the same; however,
 * Publisher is extensible via plugins to publish alternative representations of
 * the image on related subtopics. This is especially useful for limiting bandwidth and
 * latency over a network connection, when you might (for example) use the theora plugin
 * to transport the images as streamed video. All topics are published only on demand
 * (i.e. if there are subscribers).
 *
 * A Publisher should always be created through a call to ImageTransport::advertise(),
 * or copied from one that was.
 * Once all copies of a specific Publisher go out of scope, any subscriber callbacks
 * associated with that handle will stop being called. Once all Publisher for a
 * given base topic go out of scope the topic (and all subtopics) will be unadvertised.
